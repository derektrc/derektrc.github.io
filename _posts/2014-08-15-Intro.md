title: Hello World!
---

I recently became acquainted with GitHub's Pages functionality and I felt like it'd be a good place to introduce myself and host some of the past projects that I've worked on in the past few years. A little bit about myself, I've recently graduated from the [UIUC](http://www.illinois.edu) with a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering. 

During my undergrad, I've lead and worked on a bunch of projects ranging from research-y (Computer Vision, UAVs, GPS) to fun, startup-y (Mobile, Web, [Cozad](http://tec.illinois.edu/cozad)) ones. In the past I've used Assembla and SVN for most of the collaboration work on my personal, hackathon, research, and developmental projects. As some of them have been completed and cleared for release, I'll be posting their source codes to my [GitHub Page](http://www.github.com/derektrc). In the meantime, please bear with the transition and welcome to my site!
