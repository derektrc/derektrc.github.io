Woof! Intelligent Home Security System
---
Woof! was made during my junior year and entered intially into IEEE-UIUC's Make-it-Happen Competition and Engineering Open House. My goal was to provide students a low-cost, alternative security system. I found that most systems on the security market were either too expensive, such as ADT and SafeGuard, or too timely to set up, such as DIY cameras and servers, for students to own. As a result most students leave their apartments and dorm rooms unguarded, during class hours and especially during holiday breaks. After hearing of a few break-ins, my team partner Zach Li and I created this system which we entered in the Cozad New Venture competition. Woof! is an automated system that you place in the main living area of your apartment. Afterwards it will automatically learn your general behaviors and the environment of your home. Whenever an anomaly is detected such as a break-in or natural hazard, Woof! relays an alert to your mobile device and then allows you to look through its eyes to the source of the alert.
