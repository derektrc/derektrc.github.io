Hi There! Welcome to my website. A little bit about myself, I am a current Masters Student in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My professional interests are in Autonomous Systems and Navigation, Machine Learning and Big Data for deeper societal understanding, and Mobile Projects that help people connect.

I started my research through my initial interests in GPS and how it enabled easy-outdoors navigation. Currently I am working on distributed and cooperative localization and navigation through multi-agent systems. 

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to send me an email at derektrc@gmail.com or chen376@illinois.edu.

Thanks for reading!
